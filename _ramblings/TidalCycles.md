title: 'Dockerizing TidalCycles and Extramuros' 
order: 1
---

- Installing [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org/) can be tricky and booting up a working environment can be a barrier to entry (no one wants to have to debug installation issues when they're just trying to jam...)
- I dockerized Tidal 
- I also wanted an instance of [extramuros](https://github.com/dktr0/extramuros) that I could spin-up and spin-down easily for collaborative online live-coding with Tidal
- I dockerized Extramuros too and developed a basic Terraform file for provisioning and deploying Extramuros to GCP.
