I am a full-stack software developer and designer with a background in Human-Computer Interaction and New Media.

I work at Unity Health Toronto as the Director of Product Development for the Data Science and Advanced Analytics team (DSAA). At DSAA we develop machine learning and data science products that aim to improve patient outcomes and system efficiency at our 3 hospitals (St. Michael's, St. Joseph's Health Centre, and Providence Healthcare).

I am passionate about electronic music and in my free time enjoy creating new experimental software for music performance (and sometimes I also get around to actually performing with it...).
